###How to run:

* Add ALL the files to your favourite IDE and compile and the project! 

####Notes on running:
	
* Must use a standard C++11 compiler 
* Some IDEs like Xcode might require you to add external files (.txt) to the project directory, ie. specify the working directory. Make sure to specify your working directory so that the .txt files (particularly the saveData.txt) can be found.
* Don't forget to read the comments in code for clarification!
